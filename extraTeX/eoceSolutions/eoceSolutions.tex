%% 9.1 CASE STUDY: PREVENTING PEANUT ALLERGIES
	
% 1

\eocesol{(a)~Treatment: $10/43 = 0.23 \rightarrow 23\%$. \\
	Control: $2/46 = 0.04 \rightarrow 4\%$. \\
(b)~At first glance, it appears patients in the treatment group seem more 
likely to experience pain reduction from the acupuncture treatment. There is a 19\% difference between the pain reduction rates in the two 
groups, with the treatment group experiencing the higher pain reduction rate.}

% 2 

\eocesol{(a)~Treatment: $66/85 = 0.78 \rightarrow 78\%$ of patients in the treatment group experienced a significant improvement in symptoms. \\
	Control: $66/81 = 0.80 \rightarrow 80\%$ of patients in the control group experienced a significant improvement in symptoms. \\
	(b)~The control group's symptomatic treatments appear to be more effective than the treatment group's amoxicillin treatment because the control group has a higher percentage of patients who reported significant improvement in symptoms than the treatment group (80\% vs. 78\%). \\
	(c)~Answers may vary but should be sensible. Possible answer: Because the observed 2\% difference is rather small, the observed difference may well be simply due to chance.}


%% 9.2 DATA BASICS


% 3

\eocesol{(a)~143,196 eligible study subjects born in Southern California between 1989 
	and 1993. \\
	(b)~Measurements of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate 
	matter less than 10$\mu g/m^3$ (PM$_{10}$) collected at air-quality-monitoring 
	stations as well as length of gestation. Continuous numerical variables.  \\
	(c)~"Is there an association between air pollution 
	exposure and incidence of preterm births?"}

% 4

\eocesol{(a)~600 asthma patients, ages 18-69.  \\
	(b)~Scores on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. Ordinal categorical variables. \\
	(c)~"Is there evidence that the Buteyko method reduces asthma and improves quality of life?"}

% 5

\eocesol{(a)~The control tests are the ones in which hummingbirds are presented with either sucrose or water. The treatment tests are the ones in which hummingbirds are presented with test stimuli (aspartame, erythritol). \\
	(b)~Length of time a hummingbird drank from each of the two containers in a given trial. Numerical variable. \\
	(c)~"Does the T1R1-T1R3 taste receptor in hummingbirds play a role in detecting sweetness?"}

% 6

\eocesol{(a)~Control: the group of 16 female birds that received no treatment. Treatment: the group of 16 female birds that were given supplementary diets. \\
	(b)~"Does egg coloration indicate the health of female collared flycatchers?" \\
	(c)~Darkness of blue color in female birds' eggs. Continuous numerical variable.}

% 7

\eocesol{(a)~Each row represents a participant. \\
	(b)~1,691 participants. \\
	(c)~Sex: nominal categorical variable. Age: discrete numerical variable. Marital status: nominal categorical variable. Gross income: ordinal categorical variable. Smoking status: nominal categorical variable. Amount of smoking during weekends: discrete numerical variable. Amount of smoking during weekdays: discrete numerical variable.}

% 8

\eocesol{(a)~Each row represents a participant. \\
	(b)~The response variable is colon cancer stage. The explanatory variables are the abundance levels of the five bacterial species. \\
	(c)~Colon cancer stage: ordinal categorical variable. Abundance levels of bacterial species: continuous numerical variable.  }

% 9 

\eocesol{(a)~The population of interest consists of babies born in Southern California. The sample consists of the 143,196 babies born between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. \\
	(b)~Assuming that the sample is representative of the population of interest, the results of the study can be generalized to the population. The findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships because the study was an observational study, not an experiment.}

% 10

\eocesol{(a)~The population of interest consists of asthma patients who rely on medication for asthma treatment. The sample consists of the 600 asthma patients ages 18-69 who participated in the study. \\
	(b)~The sample may not be representative of the population because study participants were recruited, an example of a convenience sample. Thus, the results of the study may not be generalizable to the population. The findings can be used to establish causal relationships because the study is an experiment conducted with control, randomization, and a reasonably large sample size.}


% 11

\eocesol{(a)~The population of interest consists of healthy young adults. The sample consists of the 437 healthy young adult volunteers from the University of Virginia. \\
	(b)~The sample may not be representative of the population because study participants were volunteers, an example of a convenience sample. Additionally, participants were all from the University of Virginia community; it is possible that there may be a systematic difference between these young adults and those in the wider population. Thus, the results may not be generalizable to the population. Even so, many studies rely on this kind of convenience sampling. \\
  (c)~The findings can be used to establish causal relationships because the study is an experiment conducted with a control, randomization, and a reasonably large sample size.}

%% 9.3 DATA COLLECTION PRINCIPLES

% 12

\eocesol{(a)~Experiment. The researchers directly intervened and assigned treatments, manipulating the explanatory variable to examine changes in the response variable. \\
	(b)~The explanatory variable is the dose of Vitamin C taken at the onset of a cold. The response variables are cold duration and severity. \\
	(c)~Yes, there may be underlying differences between participants who choose to take the pill and participants who choose not to take the pill. The researcher's analysis may introduce confounding if it is only based on the participants who chose to take the pill.}

% 13

\eocesol{(a)~Experiment.  \\
	(b)~The treatment group consists of the individuals assigned to exercise twice a week. The control group consists of of the individuals instructed not the exercise. \\
	(c)~Yes. The blocking variable is age. \\
	(d)~The results of the study can be used to establish a causal relationship because the study is an experiment. Since the only systematic difference between the groups was the difference in the explanatory variable, it is reasonable to attribute the observed changes in the response variable to differences in the explanatory variable. The conclusions can be generalized to the larger population since the sample is representative of the population. \\
	(e)~Answers may vary. Possible answer: A more complex study design may be required in order to account for differences in participants' usual exercise habits. In the current design, individuals in the treatment group are simply instructed to exercise twice a week; for some, this could be an increase in exercise, and others, this could be a decrease. To address this issue, the treatment group participants could be instructed to exercise once a week more than usual, while the control group participants are instructed to maintain their current exercise regime. In the analysis, participants would need to be compared according to their initial exercise regimes.}

% 14

\eocesol{(a)~Experiment. \\
	(b)~The experimental group consists of the chicks that received vitamin supplements. The control group consists of the chicks that did not receive vitamin supplements. \\
	(c)~Randomization ensures that there are not systematic differences between the control and treatment groups. Even if chicks may vary in ways that affect body mass and corticosterone levels, random allocation essentially evens out such differences, on average, between the two groups. This is essential for a causal interpretation of the results to be valid.}


% 15

\eocesol{(a)~Observational study. \\
	(b)~Answers may vary. One possible confounding variable is the wealth of a country. A wealthy country's citizens tend to have a higher life expectancy due to a higher quality of life, and the country tends to have a higher percentage of internet users because there is enough money for the required infrastructure and citizens can afford computers. Wealth of a country is associated with both estimated life expectancy and percentage of internet users. Omitting the confounder from the analysis distorts the relationship between the two variables, such that there may seem to be a direct relationship when there is not.}

% 16

\eocesol{(a)~Observational study. \\
	(b)~No, observational studies can only establish correlation. \\
	(c)~Answers may vary. One possible confounding variable is final exam period. Final exam period may increase both student stress (students may study more and sleep less) and muscle cramps (students may be less active because they are studying).}

% 17 

\eocesol{(a)~Simple random sampling is reasonable if 500 students is a large enough sample size relative to the total student population of the university. \\
	(b)~Since student habits may vary by field of study, stratifying by field of study would be a reasonable decision. \\
	(c)~Students in the same class year may have more similar habits. Since clusters should be diverse with respect to the outcome of interest, this would not be a good approach.}

% 18

\eocesol{(a)~Non-responders may have a different response to this question, e.g. 
parents who returned the surveys likely don't have difficulty spending time 
with their children. \\
(b)~It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years 
later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters 
(as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might be in a lower socio-economic class than the respondents. \\
(c)~This is an observational study, not an experiment, so it is not advisable to draw conclusions about causal relationships. The relationship may be in the other direction; i.e., that these people go running precisely because they do not have joint problems. Additionally, the data are not even sufficient to provide evidence of an association between running and joint problems because data have only been collected from individuals who go running regularly. Instead, a sample of individuals should be collected that includes both people who do and do not regularly go running; the number of individuals in each group with joint problems can then be compared for evidence of an association.}

% 19

\eocesol{(a)~Effective. The random sample will likely be representative of the city. \\
	(b)~Effective. This method ensures that each neighborhood is represented in the sample. A feature of this sample is that each neighborhood will be represented by an equal number of households; this is not, however, necessarily reflective of neighborhood sizes in the city. In a simple random sample, households from smaller neighborhoods are less likely to be chosen, and vice versa for households from larger neighborhoods; this leads to a sample that is strictly representative of the population. \\
	(c)~Not effective. It seems likely that neighborhoods are more variable than the households within a single neighborhood; thus, it is inefficient to sample all the households in a selected neighborhood. \\
	(d)~Effective. This addresses the issue with the sampling strategy in (c). \\
	(e)~Not effective. The sample would not be representative of the city since households closer to the city council offices may share characteristics that households farther from the city do not have. This sampling method would result in a biased sample.}

% 20 

\eocesol{(a)~No. The study is an observational study, so only conclusions about correlation can be drawn. However, it is important to note that an experiment would not be ethical here. \\
	(b)~No, because it implies a causal relationship between sleep disorders and bullying. In this case, we can at most conclude that there is a correlation between symptoms of sleep disorders and bullying in school children.}

% 21 

\eocesol{The lead author's statements are not accurate because he or she drew conclusions about causation (that increased alcohol sales taxes lower rates of sexually transmitted infections) from an observational study. In addition, although the study observed that there was a decline in gonorrhea rate, the lead author generalized the observation to all sexually transmitted infections.}


%% 9.4 NUMERICAL DATA

% 22
\eocesol{(a)~The two distributions have the same median since they have the same middle number when ordered from least to greatest. Distribution 2 has a higher IQR because its first and third quartiles are farther apart than in Distribution 2. \\
	(b)~Distribution 2 has a higher median since it has a higher middle number when ordered from least to greatest. Distribution 2 has a higher IQR because its first and third quartiles are farther apart than in Distribution 1. \\
	(c)~Distribution 2 has a higher median since all values in this distribution are higher than in Distribution 1. The two distributions have the same IQR since the distance between the first and third quartiles in each distribution is the same. \\
	(d)~Distribution 2 has a higher median since most values in this distribution are higher than those in Distribution 1. Distribution 2 has a higher IQR because its first and third quartiles are farther apart than those of Distribution 1.}

% 23

\eocesol{(a)~Distribution~2 has a higher mean since $20 > 13$, and a higher standard deviation 
since 20 is further from the rest of the data than 13. \\
(b)~Distribution~1 has a higher mean since $-20 > -40$, and Distribution~2 has a 
higher standard deviation since -40 is farther away from the rest of the data than -20. \\
(c)~Distribution~2 has a higher mean since all values in this distribution are higher 
than those in Distribution~1, but both distribution have the same standard deviation 
since they are equally variable around their respective means. \\
(d)~Both distributions have the same mean since they are both centered at 300, but 
Distribution~2 has a higher standard deviation since the observations are farther from 
the mean than in Distribution~1.}

% 24

\eocesol{(a)~Symmetric, centered at 60. Boxplot 2.
	(b)~Symmetric, centered at 50. Boxplot 3.
	(c)~Right skew, centered at 1. Boxplot 1.}

% 25

\eocesol{(a)~The distribution is bimodal, with peaks between 15-20 and 25-30. Values range from 0 to 65.  \\
(b)~The median AQI is about 30. \\
(c)~I would expect the mean to be higher than the median, since there is some right skewing.}

% 26 

\eocesol{(a)~Symmetric. There are no outliers; the boxplot does not show points outside the range of the whiskers. \\
	(b)~ Answers may vary. The histogram is more informative because it provides a more detailed picture of how the data are distributed, while the boxplot does not provide information about the overall shape of the distribution. Alternatively, the boxplot more clearly shows the median and interquartile range. \\
	(c)~Answers may vary. Various factors could influence the number of elderly people in a given state who choose to live in nursing homes. In states that are more sparsely populated, more residents might choose to stay in nursing homes because of the difficulties associated with living in rural areas, such as absence of easily accessible medical care. In wealthier states, however, people are less likely to live in nursing homes because of their ability to afford the costs of staying home (e.g. in-home nursing care); Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid pay quite a lot of nursing home costs.}

% 27

\eocesol{(a)~The distribution of the scores show right skew. The scores range from 0 to about 18, with the majority of scores under 10. \\
	(b)~Since the distribution is skewed, the robust measures of center and spread, median and IQR, provide a better summary of the data.}

% 28

\eocesol{No, the midrange is sensitive to outliers and extreme skew since it is calculated using the two most extreme values in the distribution. If the extreme values in the distribution change, then the midrange will change, even if the rest of the distribution did not change.}

%% 9.5 CATEGORICAL DATA

% 29

\eocesol{(a)~Conservatives: 372/910 = 0.41 $\rightarrow$ 41\% \\
	(b)~In favor of the citizenship option: 278/910 = 0.31 $\rightarrow$ 31\% \\
	(c)~Conservative and in favor of the citizenship option: 57/910 = 0.06 $\rightarrow$ 6\% \\
	(d)~In favor of the citizenship option among conservatives: 57/372 = 0.15 $\rightarrow$ 15\% 
	In favor of the citizenship option among moderates: 120/363 = 0.33 $\rightarrow$ 33\%
	In favor of the citizenship option among liberals: 101/175 = 0.58 $\rightarrow$ 58\%}

% 30

\eocesol{(a)~These data are categorical. They can be summarized numerically in either a frequency table or relative frequency table, and summarized graphically in a bar plot of either counts or proportions. \\
	(b)~The results of these studies cannot be generalized to the larger population. Individuals taking the survey represent a specific subset of the population that are conscious about dental health, since they are at the dentist's office for an appointment. Additionally, there may be response bias; even though the surveys are anonymous, it is likely that respondents will feel some pressure to give a "correct" answer in such a setting, and claim to floss more often than they actually do.}

%% 9.6 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES

% 31

\eocesol{(a)~Yes, there seems to be a positive association between lifespan and length of gestation. Generally, as gestation increases, so does life span. \\
	(b)~Positive association. Reversal of the plot axes does not change the nature of an association.}

% 32

\eocesol{(a)~Plot 1, linear. Plot 3, nonlinear.
	(b)~Plot 4, linear.
	(c)~Plot 2.}

% 33

\eocesol{(a)~75\% of the countries have an adolescent fertility rate less than or equal to 75.73 births per 1,000 adolescents. \\
	(b)~It is likely that the observations are missing due to the Iraq War and general instability in the region during this time period. It is unlikely that the five-number summary would have been affected very much, even if the values were extreme; the median and IQR are robust estimates, and the dataset is relatively large, with data from 188 other countries. \\
	(c)~The median and IQR decreases each year, with Q1 and Q3 also decreasing.}

% 34 

\eocesol{(a)~51/215 = 0.24 $\rightarrow$ 24\% of the participants were both smokers and had aortic stenosis. The other three numbers of the joint distribution are: 54/215 = 0.25 $\rightarrow$ 25\% (percent of participants who were smokers and did not have aortic stenosis); 43/215 = 0.20 $\rightarrow$ 20\% (percent of participants who were non-smokers and had aortic stenosis); and 67/215 = 0.31 $\rightarrow$ 31\% (percent of participants who were non-smokers and did not have aortic stenosis). \\
	(b)~Among the 105 smokers, 51 have aortic stenosis. Thus, 51/105 of the smokers have aortic stenosis. Among the 110 non-smokers, 43 have aortic stenosis. Thus, 43/110 of the non-smokers have aortic stenosis. \\
	(c)~The relative risk of aortic stenosis, comparing smokers to non-smokers, is $\frac{51/105}{43/110} = 1.24$. The risk of a smoker developing aortic stenosis is 1.24 times that of a non-smoker. Since the relative risk is greater than 1, there does seem to be evidence that smoking is associated with an increased probability of stenosis. The relative risk is also greater than 1.2, indicating that a smoker's probability of stenosis is alarmingly higher than that of a non-smoker.}

% 35

\eocesol{(a)~4,371/8,474 = 0.56 $\rightarrow$ 56\% \\
	(b)~110/190 = 0.58 $\rightarrow$ 58\% \\
	(c)~27/633 = 0.04 $\rightarrow$ 4\% \\
	(d)~53/3,110 = 0.02 $\rightarrow$ 2\% \\
	(e)~Relative risk: $\frac{27/633}{53/3,110} = 2.50$. Yes, since the relative risk is greater than 1. A relative risk of 2.50 indicates that individuals with high trait anger are 2.5 times more likely to experience a CHD event than individuals with low trait anger. \\
	(f)~Side-by-side boxplots, since blood cholesterol level is a numerical variable and anger group is categorical.}

%% 2.1 DEFINING PROBABILITY

%_______________
\begin{multicols}{2}

% 1

\eocesol{(a)~False. These are independent trials. \\
(b)~False. There are red face cards. \\
(c)~True. A card cannot be both a face card and an ace.}

% 2

\eocesol{(a)~0. It is impossible to roll a pair of dice and get a sum of one. The smallest possible sum is 2 (1 and 1). \\
	(b)~$\frac{4}{36}$. There are 4 possible pairs sum to 5 (1 and 4; 2 and 3; 3 and 2; 4 and 1) and a total of 36 possible pairs (6 x 6), giving a probability of $\frac{\text{number of pairs that sum to 5}}{\text{total number of pairs}}$ = $\frac{4}{36}$. \\
	(c)~$\frac{1}{36}$. There is one possible pair that sums to 12 (6 and 6) and a total of 36 possible pairs (6 x 6), giving a probability of $\frac{\text{number of pairs that sum to 12}}{\text{total number of pairs}}$ = $\frac{1}{36}$.}

% 3

\eocesol{(a)~$\frac{1}{4}$. \\
	Solution 1: A colorblind male has genotype $X^{-}Y$. He must have inherited $X^{-}$ from his mother (probability of $\frac{1}{2}$) and $Y$ from his father (probability of $\frac{1}{2}$). Since these are two independent events, the probability of both occuring is $(\frac{1}{2}) (\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{4}$. \\
	Solution 2: Determine the possibilities using a Punnett square. There are 4 equally likely possibilities, one of which is a colorblind male. Thus, the probability is $\frac{1}{4}$. 
	
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
			\hline
			& $X^{+}$ & $Y$ \\

	(b)~True. An offspring of this couple cannot be both female and colorblind.}

	(c)~0.33. $P(\text{$A$ or $B$}) = P(A) + P(B) - P(\text{$A$ and $B$}) = 0.09 + 0.30 - 0.06 = 0.33$. \\
	(d)~67\%. $P(\text{$A^{C}$ and $B^{C}$}) = 1 - P(\text{$A$ or $B$}) = 1 - 0.33 = 0.67 = 67\%$. \\
	(e)~No. If diabetes (A) and hypertension (B) were independent, $P(\text{$A$ and $B$}) = P(A)P(B)$. Since $0.06 \neq (0.09)(0.30)$, i.e. $P(\text{$A$ and $B$}) \neq P(A)P(B)$, the events are not independent.}

\eocesol{(a)~No. Someone can live below the poverty line and speak a foreign language at home. \\
	(b)
	\includegraphics[width=40mm]{ch_probability_oi_biostat/figures/eoce/poverty_language/poverty_language.pdf} \\
	(c)~10.4\%. \\
	Solution 1: The "10.4\%" portion of the Venn diagram represents Americans who live below the poverty line and do not speak a foreign language at home (i.e. only speak English at home).
	Solution 2: Let $A$ = \{living below the poverty line\} and $B$ = \{speaking a foreign language at home\}. Given $P(A) = 0.146$, $P(B) = 0.207$, and $P(A \textrm{ and }B) = 0.042$, calculate $P(A \textrm { and } B^C)$. $P(A \textrm{ and }B^C) = P(A)P(B^C | A) = P(A)(1 - P(B|A)) = P(A)(1 - \frac{P(A \textrm{ and } B)}{P(A)}) = (0.146)(1 - \frac{0.042}{0.146}) = 0.104 \rightarrow 10.4\%$  \\
	(d)~31.1\%. $P(A \textrm{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B) = 0.146 + 0.207 - 0.042 = 0.311 \rightarrow 31.1\%$. \\
	(e)~68.9\%. The group of Americans who live above the poverty line and only speak English at home is represented in the Venn diagram by the space in the rectangle but outside either of the two circles. $P(A^{C} \text{ and } B^{C}) = 1- P(A \text{ or } B) = 1- 0.311 = 0.689 = 68.9\%$. \\
	(f)~No. If $A$ and $B$ were independent events, then $P(\text{$A$ and $B$}) = P(A)P(B)$. Since $0.042 \neq (0.146)(0.207)$, i.e. $P(\text{$A$ and $B$}) \neq P(A)P(B)$, the events are not independent.

\eocesol{(a)~0.25. Let $H$ represent the event of being a high school graduate and $F$ represent the event of being a woman. $P(H) = P(H \textrm{ and } W) + P(H \textrm{ and } W^C) = P(H|W)P(W) + P(H|W^C)P(W^C) = (0.20)(0.50) + (0.30)(0.50) = 0.25$. \\

	(e)~0.065. Let $X_W$ be the event that a woman has at least a Bachelor's degree, and $X_M$ be the event that a man has at least a Bachelor's degree. Assuming that the education levels of the husband and wife are independent, $P(X_W \textrm{ and } X_M) = P(X_W) \times P(X_M) = (0.25)(0.26) = 0.065$. This assumption is probably not reasonable, because people tend to marry someone with a comparable level of education.

\eocesol{(a)~0.32. Let $D_0$, $D_1$, $D_2$, $D_3$ represent the events of missing 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more days of school per year. $P(D_0) = 1 - P(D_0^C) = 1 - (P(D_1) + P(D_2) + P(D_3)) = 1- (0.25 + 0.15 + 0.28) = 0.32$. \\
	(b)~0.57. The probability of missing at most 1 day is equal to missing either 0 days or 1 day: $P(D_0) + P(D_1) = 0.32 + 0.25 = 0.57$.\\
	(c)~0.68. The probability of missing at least 1 day is equal to missing either 1, 2, or 3 or more days: $P(D_1) + P(D_2) + P(D_3) = 0.25 + 0.15 + 0.28.$. This can also be thought of as the complement of missing 0 days: $1 - P(D_0) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68$.\\
	(d)~0.10. Assuming that the school attendance of one child is independent of that of the other child, $P(D_0) \times P(D_0) = (0.32)(0.32) = 0.10$. This assumption is probably not reasonable because the attendance of children from the same household is typically correlated. For example, the two children may have a parent that takes them to school at the same time. \\
	(e)~0.46. Assuming that the school attendance of one child is independent of that of the other child, $(0.68)(0.68) = 0.46$. This assumption is probably not reasonable because the attendance of children from the same household is typically correlated. For example, if one child becomes ill and cannot go to school, it is likely that the other child will also be ill and cannot go to school.}

\eocesol{(a)~Let $C$ represent the event that one urgent care center sees 300-449 patients in a week. Assuming that the number of patient visits are independent between urgent care centers in a given county for a given week, the probability that three random urgent care centers see 300-449 patients in a week is $[P(C)]^3 = (0.288)^3 = 0.024$. This assumption is not reasonable because a county is a small area with relatively few urgent care centers; if one urgent care center takes in more patients than usual during a given week, so might other urgent care centers in the same county (e.g., this could occur during flu season). \\

Assuming independence, the probability that 10 urgent care centers throughout a state all see 450 or more patients in a week is $[P(D)]^{10} = (0.217)^{10} = 2.32 \times 10^{-7}$. This assumption is reasonable because a state is a large area that contains many urgent care centers; the number of patients one urgent care center takes in is likely independent of the number of patients another urgent care center in the state takes in. \\

%% 2.1 CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY

% 10 (oi biostat)

\eocesol{(a)~0.25. Each parent can pass on either an A allele or a B allele with probability 0.5. For a child to have Group A blood, they must inherit an A allele from both parents. Alleles are inherited independently, thus, the probability of a child of this couple having Group A blood is $(0.50) \times (0.50) = 0.25$. \\
	(b)~0.141. The probability that one child has Type O blood is $(0.50) \times (0.50) = 0.25$, since the child must inherit the $i$ allele from both parents. The probability that a child does not have Type O blood is $1 - 0.25 =0.75$ (the complement). Each child inheriting alleles is an independent event. The probability that their first child has Type O blood and the next two do not is: $(0.25) \times (0.75) \times (0.75) = 0.141$. \\
	(c)~1/3. The event that one child has Type O blood and two do not can happen three distinct ways: either the first, second, or third child is the one child with Type O blood. Neither child is more or less likely to have Type O blood, so the conditional probability that it is the first child given the stated condition equals $1/3$ by symmetry. This can also be approached algebraically; let $A$ be the event that the first child has Type O blood and $B$ be the event that one child has Type O blood and two do not.
	\[P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \dfrac{(0.25)(0.75)(0.75)}{(3)(0.25)(0.75)(0.75)} = \dfrac{1}{3} \] }

\eocesol{(a)~In descending order on the table, the PPV for each age group is 0.070, 0.202, 0.293, 0.386, 0.403. As the prevalence of breast cancer increases, PPV also increases. If more women have the disease, the chance of a positive test result being a true positive increases (and the chances of the result being a false positive decreases). \\
	Consider the denominator, which quantifies the number of true positives and false positives. When prevalence increases, even though both the numerator and denominator are increasing from $[prev \times sensitivity]$, the denominator is also decreasing from $[(1-prev) \times (1-specificity)]$ decreasing (since as prevalence increases, the quantity $(1 - prev)$ decreases). Since sensitivity and specificity are constant, increasing prevalence has the effect of increasing the number of true positives (left term) and decreasing the number of false positives (right term). PPV increases when the number of true positives increases. \\
	(b)~ The technology that raises specificity to 99\% offers a higher increase. Since prevalence of the disease only ranges between less than 1\% to at most $\sim$ 4\%, most of the people tested do not have breast cancer. This implies that the low PPV is largely due to the high number of false positives. This value is related to the specificity. If specificity increases, this increases the number of true negatives and decreases the number of false positives. Increasing sensitivity can potentially increase the number of true positives detected and raise PPV, but this does not have as strong an effect.}

	(b)~As prevalence of prostate cancer increases by age group, PPV also increases. However, with rising prevalence, NPV decreases.\\
	(c)~The probability that a man has prostate cancer, given a positive test, necessarily increases as the overall probability of having prostate cancer increases. If more men have the disease, the chance of a positive test result being a true positive increases (and the chances of the result being a false positive decreases). The decreasing NPV values follow similar logic: if more men have the disease, the chance of a negative test being a true negative decreases (and the chances of the result being a false negative increases).  \\
	(d)~Lowering the cutoff for a positive test would result in more men testing positive, since men with PSA values 2.5 ng/ml to 4.1 ng/ml were not previously classified as testing positive. Since the sensitivity of a test is the proportion who test positive among those who have disease, and the number with disease does not change, the proportion will increase, except in the rare and unlikely situation where the additional positive tests are among only men without the disease.}

However, this is not necessarily due to oversight on the hospital administrator's part; other factors may be at work. For example, perhaps increased wait times are due to more patients checking into the ER this year than last year. Alternatively, a sample size of 64 is relatively small, and it is certainly possible that extreme outliers may have overly influenced the mean. It would be advisable to take a closer look at the data distribution or repeat the test once more data have been collected.

\eocesol{(a)~We will conduct a 1-sample $t$-test. $H_0$: $\mu = 5$. $H_A$: $\mu < 5$. We'll use $\alpha = 0.05$. This is a random sample, so the observations are independent. To proceed, we assume the distribution of years of piano lessons is approximately normal. $SE = 2.2 / \sqrt{20} = 0.4919$. The test statistic is $T = (4.6 - 5) / SE = -0.81$. $df = 20 - 1 = 19$. The one-tail p-value is about 0.21, which is bigger than $\alpha = 0.05$, so we do not reject $H_0$. That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence to reject Georgianna's claim. \\
(b)~Using $SE = 0.4919$ and $t_{df = 19}^{\star} = 2.093$, the confidence interval is (3.57, 5.63). We are 95\% confident that the average number of years a child takes piano lessons in this city is 3.57 to 5.63 years. \\

If you chose a two-sided test, that would also be acceptable. If this is the case, note that your p-value will be a little bigger than what is reported here in part~(d).

\eocesol{(a)~These data are paired. For example, the Friday the 13th in say, September 1991, would probably be more similar to the Friday the 6th in September 1991 than to Friday the 6th in another month or year.
(b)~Let $\mu_{diff} = \mu_{sixth} - \mu_{thirteenth}$. $H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$. $H_A: \mu_{diff} \ne 0$.
(c)~Independence: The months selected are not random. However, if we think these dates are roughly equivalent to a simple random sample of all such Friday 6th/13th date pairs, then independence is reasonable. To proceed, we must make this strong assumption, though we should note this assumption in any reported results. With fewer than 10 observations, we would need to use the $t$-distribution to model the sample mean. The normal probability plot of the differences shows an approximately straight line. There isn't a clear reason why this distribution would be skewed, and since the normal quantile plot looks reasonable, we can mark this condition as reasonably satisfied.

(We might believe this intersection is representative of all roads, i.e. there is higher traffic on Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ relative to Friday the 13$^{\text{th}}$. However, we should be cautious of the required assumption for such a generalization.)
(f)~If the average number of cars passing the intersection actually was the same on Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ and $13^{th}$, then the probability that we would observe a test statistic so far from zero is less than 0.01.

The data provide strong evidence that the average number of traffic accident related emergency room admissions are different between Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ and Friday the 13$^{\text{th}}$. Furthermore, the data indicate that the direction of that difference is that accidents are lower on Friday the $6^{th}$ relative to Friday the 13$^{\text{th}}$.
(b)~(-6.49, -0.17).
(c)~This is an observational study, not an experiment, so we cannot so easily infer a causal intervention implied by this statement. It is true that there is a difference.

% 37
\eocesol{Let $\mu_{diff} = \mu_{pre} - \mu_{post}$. $H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$: Treatment has no effect. $H_A: \mu_{diff} > 0$: Treatment is effective in reducing P.D.T. scores, the average pre-treatment score is higher than the average post-treatment score. Note that the reported values are pre minus post, so we are looking for a positive difference, which would correspond to a reduction in the P.D.T. score. Conditions are checked as follows. Independence: The subjects are randomly assigned to treatments, so the patients in each group are independent. All three sample sizes are smaller than 30, so we use $t$-tests. Distributions of differences are somewhat skewed. The sample sizes are small, so we cannot reliably relax this assumption. (We will proceed, but we would not report the results of this specific analysis, at least for treatment group 1.) For all three groups: $df=13$. $T_1= 1.89$ ($0.025<$ p-value $<0.05$), $T_2=1.35$ (p-value = 0.10), $T_3 = -1.40$ (p-value $>0.10$). The only significant test reduction is found in Treatment 1, however, we had earlier noted that this result might not be reliable due to the skew in the distribution. Note that the calculation of the p-value for Treatment 3 was unnecessary: the sample mean indicated a increase in P.D.T. scores under this treatment (as opposed to a decrease, which was the result of interest). That is, we could tell without formally completing the hypothesis test that the p-value would be large for this treatment group.}

Approx. normal: the distributions of weights within each feed type appear to be fairly symmetric. Constant variance: Based on the side-by-side box plots, the constant variance assumption appears to be reasonable. There are differences in the actual computed standard deviations, but these might be due to chance as these are quite small samples. $F_{5,65} = 15.36$ and the p-value is approximately 0. With such a small p-value, we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that the average weight of chicks varies across some (or all) feed supplement groups.}

(b)~Independence: We don't have any information on how the data were collected, so we cannot assess independence. To proceed, we must assume the subjects in each group are independent. In practice, we would inquire for more details. Approx. normal: The data are bound below by zero and the standard deviations are larger than the means, indicating very strong skew. However, since the sample sizes are extremely large, even extreme skew is acceptable. Constant variance: This condition is sufficiently met, as the standard deviations are reasonably consistent across groups.

Use the following hypotheses for each pairwise test. $H_0$: The two means are equal. $H_A$: The two means are different. The sample sizes are equal and we use the pooled SD, so we can compute $SE=3.7$ with the pooled $df=39$. The p-value only for Trmt 1 vs. Trmt 3 may be statistically significant: $0.01<$ p-value $<0.02$. Since we cannot tell, we should use a computer to get the p-value, 0.015, which is statistically significant for the adjusted significance level. That is, we have identified Treatment 1 and Treatment 3 as having different effects. Checking the other two comparisons, the differences are not statistically significant.}

an additional 0.9112 years in wife's age. This means that wives' ages 
tend to be lower for later ages, suggesting the average gap of husband 
and wife age is larger for older people.
Intercept: Men who are 0 years old are expected to have wives who are on 
average 1.5740 years old. The intercept here is meaningless and serves only 
to adjust the height of the line.
(d)~$R = \sqrt{0.88} = 0.94$. The regression of wives' ages on husbands' 
ages has a positive slope, so the correlation coefficient will be positive.
(e)~$\widehat{age}_W = 1.5740 + 0.9112 \times 55 = 51.69$.
Since $R^2$ is pretty high, the prediction based on this regression model 
is reliable.
(f)~No, we shouldn't use the same model to predict an 85 year old man's 
wife's age. This would require extrapolation. The scatterplot from an 
earlier exercise shows that husbands in this data set are approximately 
20 to 65 years old. The regression model may not be reasonable outside 
of this range.}

higher calorie counts, and it looks like there might be two clusters 
of observations above and below the line on the right, so we should 
be cautious about fitting a linear model to these data.}

(b)~The estimated body weight of babies born to smoking mothers is 8.94 
ounces lower than babies born to non-smoking mothers.  
Smoker: $123.05 - 8.94 \times 1 = 114.11$ ounces. 
Non-smoker: $123.05 - 8.94 \times 0 = 123.05$ ounces.
(c)~$H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$. $H_A$: $\beta_1 \ne 0$. $T= -8.65$, and the p-value is 
approximately 0. Since the p-value is very small, we reject $H_0$. The data 
provide strong evidence that the true slope parameter is different than 0 and 
that there is an association between birth weight and smoking. Furthermore, 
having rejected $H_0$, we can conclude that smoking is associated with lower 
birth weights.}

the baby for each additional year in mother's age, all else held constant.

With so many observations in the data set,
we look for particularly extreme outliers
in the histogram and do not see any.
variability of residuals: The scatterplot of the residuals versus the fitted 
values does not show any overall structure. However, values that have very low 
or very high fitted values appear to also have somewhat larger outliers. In 
addition, the residuals do appear to have constant variability between the two 
parity and smoking status groups, though these items are relatively minor. \\ 
Independent residuals: The scatterplot of residuals versus the order of data 
collection shows a random scatter, suggesting that there is no apparent 
structures related to the order the data were collected. \\ Linear relationships 
between the response variable and numerical explanatory variables: The residuals 
vs. height and weight of mother are randomly distributed around 0. The residuals 
vs. length of gestation plot also does not show any clear or strong remaining 
structures, with the possible exception of very short or long gestations. The 
rest of the residuals do appear to be randomly distributed around 0. \\All 
concerns raised here are relatively mild. There are some outliers, but there is 
so much data that the influence of such observations will be minor.}

\eocesol{(a)~False.
    When predictors are collinear, it means they are correlated,
    and the inclusion of one variable can have a substantial
    influence on the point estimate (and standard error) of
    another.
(b)~True.
(c)~False.
    This would only be the case if the data was from
    an experiment and $x_1$ was one of the variables set by
    the researchers.
    (Multiple regression can be useful for forming hypotheses
    about causal relationships, but it offers zero guarantees.)
(d)~False.
    We should check normality like we would for inference
    for a single mean:
    we look for particularly extreme outliers if $n \geq 30$
    or for clear outliers if $n < 30$.}

\eocesol{(a)~False. Doesn't satisfy success-failure condition.
(b)~True. The success-failure condition is not satisfied. In most samples we 
would expect $\hat{p}$ to be close to 0.08, the true population proportion. 
While $\hat{p}$ can be much above 0.08, it is bound below by 0, suggesting it 
would take on a right skewed shape. Plotting the sampling distribution would 
confirm this suspicion.
(c)~False. $SE_{\hat{p}} = 0.0243$, and $\hat{p} = 0.12$ is only 
$\frac{0.12 - 0.08}{0.0243} = 1.65$ SEs away from the mean, which would not 
be considered unusual.

(d)~Yes. The interval lies entirely above 50\%.}


\eocesol{oi4 10, needs solution}

\eocesol{(a)~We want to check for a majority (or minority),
    so we use the following hypotheses:
    \begin{align*}
    &H_0: p = 0.5
    &&H_A: p \neq 0.5
    \end{align*}
    We have a sample proportion of $\hat{p} = 0.55$
    and a sample size of $n = 617$ independents. \\
    Since this is a random sample, independence
    is satisfied.
    The success-failure condition is also satisfied:
    $617 \times 0.5$ and $617 \times (1 - 0.5)$
    are both at least 10 (we use the null proportion
    $p_0 = 0.5$ for this check in a one-proportion
    hypothesis test). \\
    Therefore, we can model $\hat{p}$ using a
    normal distribution with a standard error of
    \begin{align*}
    SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}
      = 0.02
    \end{align*}
    (We use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$
    to compute the standard error for a
    one-proportion hypothesis test.)
    Next, we compute the test statistic:
    \begin{align*}
    Z = \frac{0.55 - 0.5}{0.02} = 2.5
    \end{align*}
    This yields a one-tail area of 0.0062,
    and a p-value of $2 \times 0.0062 = 0.0124$. \\
    Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05,
    we reject the null hypothesis.
    We have strong evidence that the support
    is different from 0.5, and since the data
    provide a point estimate above 0.5,
    we have strong evidence to support this
    claim by the TV pundit. \\
(b)~No.
    Generally we expect a hypothesis test
    and a confidence interval to align,
    so we would expect the confidence interval
    to show a range of plausible values
    entirely above 0.5.
    However, if the confidence level is
    misaligned (e.g. a 99\% confidence level
    and a $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level),
    then this is no longer generally true.}

% 15

\eocesol{Since a sample proportion ($\hat{p} = 0.55$) is available,
we use this for the sample size calculations.
The margin of error for a 90\% confidence interval is
$1.65 \times SE = 1.65 \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}$.
We want this to be less than 0.01, where we use
$\hat{p}$ in place of $p$:
\begin{align*}
1.65 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.55(1 - 0.55)}{n}} \leq 0.01 \\
1.65^2 \frac{0.55(1 - 0.55)}{0.01^2} \leq n
\end{align*}
From this, we get that $n$ must be at least 6739.}

\eocesol{This is not a randomized experiment, and it is unclear whether people would 
be affected by the behavior of their peers. That is, independence may not 
hold. Additionally, there are only 5 interventions under the provocative 
scenario, so the success-failure condition does not hold. Even if we consider 
a hypothesis test where we pool the proportions, the success-failure 
condition will not be satisfied. Since one condition is questionable and the 
other is not satisfied, the difference in sample proportions will not follow 
a nearly normal distribution.}
